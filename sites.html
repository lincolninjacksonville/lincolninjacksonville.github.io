					<p><img src="images/lincoln-sites-1-beecher.jpg" width="300" height="199" /></p>
					<p><em>Illinois College Campus</em>
					  <span class="style1"><br />
					  Tune Radio to 92.5 FM </span><br />
					  Beecher Hall, which was built in 1829-30 and originally
					  was known as the College Building, is the only structure
					  remaining on the Illinois College campus that would have
					  been familiar to New Salem friends of Abraham Lincoln,
					  several of whom, including David Rutledge, William Berry,
					  Harvey Ross and William and Lynn Greene, attended IC in
					  the 1830s. The New Salem residents most likely studied and
					  prayed within Beecher Hall’s walls, because in the early days
					  of IC, the building contained a classroom, a library, a chapel
					  and a dormitory. Beecher Hall was named after Edward
				    Beecher, the first president of IC, in 1888.</p>
					
					<h3>2. David A. Smith House</h3>
					<p><img src="images/lincoln-sites-2-smith.jpg" width="300" height="216" /></p>
				  <p><em>1061 Grove Street, SE Corner of Grove and Park</em><br />
				        <span class="style1">Tune Radio to 92.5 FM</span><br />
			        David A. Smith, a Jacksonville attorney and colleague of
				    Abraham Lincoln, had this two-story, Federal-style house
				    built between 1852 and 1854. When Lincoln had legal
				    business in Jacksonville, he used Smith’s law office as his
				    headquarters. Records indicate that Lincoln and Smith were
				    associated with 68 cases as either co-counselors or opposing
				    attorneys. In one of their more famous cases, Lincoln
				    represented wealthy Jacksonville businessman Colonel James
				    Dunlap, while Smith represented Jacksonville newspaper
				    editor Paul Selby. Selby sued
				    Dunlap for $10,000 in actual and
				    punitive damages after Dunlap
				    and some of his associates
				    allegedly battered him. Ultimately,
				    the jury found for Selby, but only
			      awarded him $300 in damages.</p>
					<h3>3. Governor Duncan Mansion
		      </h3>
			  		  <p><img src="images/lincoln-sites-3-duncan.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></p>
				      <p><em>4 Duncan Place, Centrally located in Duncan Park</em><br />
				        <span class="style1">Tune Radio to 92.5 FM</span><br />
				        Governor Joseph Duncan, who served as governor of Illinois
					    from 1834 to 1838, had this two- and one-half-story house
					    constructed between 1833 and 1835. Tradition says that Lincoln
					    visited the Duncan home, and it is quite possible that happened,
					    given the fact that Lincoln lived in nearby New Salem and
					    Springfield during the time both
					    men were members of the Whig
					    Party. Lincoln served his first two
					    terms as a state representative while
					    Duncan was governor. In addition,
					    voting records show that Lincoln
					    cast ballots for Duncan three
		      times. Tours available.</p>
					<h3>4. Newton Bateman House </h3>
					<p><img src="images/lincoln-sites-4-bateman.jpg" width="216" height="181" /></p>
					<p><em>907 West State Street</em><br />
					  <span class="style1">Tune Radio to 92.5 FM</span><br />
					  Newton Bateman, a well-known educator in Illinois in the
					  1800s and friend of Abraham Lincoln, lived in this Gothic
					  Revival-style house in the 1850s. He was principal of what
					  is purported to be the first free public high school in Illinois
					  &#8212; West Jacksonville District School &#8212; in the 1850s. Bateman,
					  while serving as state superintendent of schools, had an office
					  next to President-elect Lincoln in the Illinois Capitol in
					  Springfield, and the two men became friends in the months
					  prior to Lincoln’s
					  departure for Washington,
					  D.C. Bateman is said
					  to have been the last
					  person to shake hands
					  with Lincoln as the train
				    pulled away from the Springfield depot.</p>
					<h3>5. Lincoln and Slavery Mural</h3>
					<p> <img src="images/lincoln-sites-5-mural.jpg" width="300" height="197" /></p>
					<p><em>South Sandy Street</em> <br />
				    <span class="style1">Tune Radio to 92.5 FM</span><br />
			          (The mural is painted on the side of the building on Sandy Street,
					      at the southwest corner of Central Park.)<br />
				      In 1856, Abraham Lincoln delivered a speech in the Morgan
				      County Courthouse park, now known as Central Park Plaza,
				      sharing his views about one of the hotly debated topics of the
				      day &#8212; the extension of slavery into newly organized territories
					      of the United States. Joseph O. King, a local merchant, later
					      recalled Lincoln’s stirring oratory. "One of the first strong antislavery
					      speeches made here was by Abraham Lincoln,"
					      remembered King. "He spoke
					      in the courthouse park, and
					      when he came out sharp
					      and strong against slavery, I
					      threw up my hat and shouted,
				        ‘Hurray for Abe Lincoln for president of the United States.'"</p>
					<h3>6. 1859 Senate Race </h3>
					<p><em>Northeast corner of square </em><br />
                        <span class="style1">Tune Radio to 92.5 FM</span><br />
  On Monday September 27th, Lincoln arrived in Jacksonville by train from Springfield and was met by large delegations from Morgan, Cass, and Scott Counties. They moved from the depot to the square where Lincoln made one of his sixty-three speeches he had done across the state, contesting for the U.S. Senate. Lincoln was said to have spoken for two and a half hours.</p>
					<h3>7. James Jaquess House </h3>
					<p><img src="images/lincoln-sites-6-jaquess.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></p>
					<p><em>339 East State Street</em><br />
				      <span class="style1">Tune Radio to 92.5 FM</span><br />
				      James Jaquess, the
					    first president of the
					    Illinois Conference
					    Female Academy, now
					    MacMurray College,
					    once lived in this house.
					    Jaquess, a Methodist
					    minister, first met
					    Lincoln when he was preaching and Lincoln was practicing
					    law in central Illinois. During the Civil War, Lincoln entrusted
					    Jaquess with important missions. In 1863, Jaquess met with
					    Confederate officials to discuss ending the war. The following
					    year, Jaquess met with Confederate President Jefferson Davis,
					    who declared that the South would accept peace only if
					    it could remain independent. Jaquess gave an oral report
					    to Lincoln that was transcribed and printed as campaign
		      literature for the Union Republican Party.</p>
					<h3>8. The Civil War Governor </h3>
					<p><em>East State Street</em><br />
                        <span class="style1">Tune Radio to 92.5 FM</span><br />
 Richard Yates, the first graduate of Illinois College, shared strong views with Abraham Lincoln; they both supported the Whig Party and strongly opposed Stephen A. Douglas. Yates was the Radical Republican Governor of Illinois during the Civil War. He made trips to visit and encourage troops by supporting the sick and wounded. This is why he became known as the "Soldier's Friend." As the war was ending, Yates became a member of the U.S. Senate. </p>
					<h3>9. Whig Rivals and Friends </h3>
					<p><em>500 East State Street</em><br />
                        <span class="style1">Tune Radio to 92.5 FM</span><br />
  In 1831 John J. Hardin moved to Jacksonville. Hardin and Lincoln served in the Black Hawk War and they both were lawyers and Whig politicians who became rivals for leadership of the party. It is said that Hardin may have saved Lincoln's life by rushing to an island near Alton to stop a duel between Lincoln and General James Shields, at whom Lincoln poked fun in a published letter. Hardin persuaded the men to come to a compromise.</p>
					<h3>10. General Benjamin Grierson Mansion</h3>
			  <p><img src="images/lincoln-sites-7-grierson.jpg" width="300" height="183" /></p>
					<p><em>852 East State Street</em><br />
				      <span class="style1">Tune Radio to 92.5 FM</span><br />
				      Civil War hero General Benjamin Grierson once called this large
					    brick house home. In the mid-1850s, while living in Meredosia,
					    Grierson joined the new Republican Party and became
					    friends with one of its leaders, Abraham Lincoln. In 1860,
					    Grierson, an accomplished musician, wrote campaign music for
					    Lincoln’s first presidential campaign. The following year found
					    Grierson answering his friend President Lincoln's call to arms.
					    Grierson's actions during the four bloody years of the Civil War
					    transformed
					    the musician
					    and bandleader
					    into a nationally
					    known cavalry
					    commander
					    for the Union
		      Army.<br />
