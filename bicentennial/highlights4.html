			  <p>Composer William Himes, conductor of the Salvation Army Staff Band of Chicago, will direct more than 80 singers and instrumentalists in a performance of “A Lincoln Reflection” on Saturday, February 21. Himes’ original composition was commissioned by Jacksonville’s Lincoln Bicentennial Commission and will be presented under the auspices of the Illinois College Fine Arts Series.</p>
	    <p> Tickets for the 7:30 p.m. performance are priced at $15 and will be sold at the door. The event is part of the 2008-2009 concert season presented by the college’s fine arts series. Admission is free to all students, regardless of where they attend class.</p>
	          <p> In addition to the Salvation Army Staff Band of Chicago, the world premiere performance will feature the combined voices of the Illinois College Concert Choir along with members of the MacMurray College Concert Choir and the Jacksonville High School Concert Choir.</p>
	          <p> The commissioned piece by Himes will feature excerpts from Lincoln’s 1840 poem, “My Childhood’s Home,” and his Second Inaugural Address, which Lincoln gave on March 4, 1865. The composer said concert fans who enjoy serious music and the legacy of Abraham Lincoln should find the concert program to be very appealing. The pivotal events of 1865 – when the Civil War ended and Lincoln was assassinated – provide a central theme to the evening program, according to the Chicago-based composer. The concert repertoire will also include Jerry Bilik’s American Civil War Fantasy and a tuba solo titled “Celestial Morn” which is a serious work based on the old slave song, “Massah’s in the Cold, Cold Ground.” </p>
	          <p> As the Army’s principal ensemble of the Midwest, the band’s innovative program is designed to inspire as well as entertain. The Salvation Army Staff Band of Chicago performed for the Illinois College Fine Arts Series in 2006, and the community’s overwhelming response at that time was one of the principal reasons for this encore engagement, according to Dr. Rudolf Zuiderveld of the Illinois College Music Department. </p>
  			  <p> The ensemble is comprised of officers, staff and lay persons from the Army’s administrative headquarters in metropolitan Chicago and has come to represent the best of the Salvation Army band tradition. Along with their many hours of volunteer service, all bandsmen bring a diversity of background and vocation which combines effectively in the band’s singleness of purpose: to honor God through the ministry of The Salvation Army. </p>
  The Chicago Staff Band has toured in England, Canada, Australia and extensively in the United States. They have performed in London at the famed Royal Albert Hall as well as the Buckingham Palace.</p>
	         
                <p> Additional ticket information is available by contacting Illinois College at 245-3069.<br />
