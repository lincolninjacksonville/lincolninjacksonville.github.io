	<h3>&#8220;A logical alma mater: Abraham Lincoln and Illinois College&#8221;</h3>
	<p><img src="images/Illinois-Heritage-250.jpg" width="250" height="329" align="right" border="1" style="margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px;" /><i>By Loreli Steuer, Illinois Heritage magazine</i><br>
March-April 2007 edition &mdash Note: The following paper was presented during the Illinois College Alumni Weekend's "Thinkin' Lincoln" festivities in June 2006.</p>

<p>Welcome to Beecher Hall where the first college classes in the state of Illinois were held 176 years ago beginning on January 4, 1830. Close to that time, in 1831, a young man of 22 named Abraham Lincoln arrived in New Salem, Illinois, just 30 miles away. In the next decade, Lincoln would form six close friendships with IC students and have enough direct and indirect contact with the school throughout his lifetime for a history writer named Eleanor Atkinson to refer, in the early 1900s, to Illinois College as "Lincoln's Alma Mater." <a href="http://www.lib.niu.edu/2007/ih030716.html">[More story]</a></p>
