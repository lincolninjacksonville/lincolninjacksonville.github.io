		      <h3>JUNE 2009</h3>
			  <p> An Elder Hostel on the Life and Times of Abraham Lincoln in Illinois will be held at Illinois College during the middle of June. <em>More information coming.</em></p>
			  <p><strong><img src="images/icon-theater.gif" width="39" height="30" /> <img src="images/icon-music.gif" width="22" height="30" /> June 19-20-21: </strong>Grierson Days will feature re-enactments of Civil War Cavalry Battles, a period ball, games and foods of the era, and dramatic recreations of Lincoln's and Grierson's important connections and friendship. Three Days of Historic Facts, Fantasy, and Fun. Open to the Public.</p>
			  <p><strong><img src="images/icon-hat.gif" width="27" height="30" /><img src="images/icon-theater.gif" width="39" height="30" /> <img src="images/icon-music.gif" width="22" height="30" /> June 27: </strong> “Juneteenth” will include in its celebration of the month (June) and the year (1861) when the last slaves in America were notified that Slavery was no more. This time marks the end of Lincoln's quest for “liberty and justice for all' and the true end of slavery. Sojourner Truth and other African-American anti- slavery heroes will discuss their friendships with Lincoln and Lincoln will state some of his strongest and most memorable words on the evils of slavery. The event will also feature food, dress, crafts and games of the era. As well as modern style shows and entertainers.</p>
			  <h3>JULY 2009 </h3>
			  <p><strong><img src="images/icon-hat.gif" width="27" height="30" /> July 4:</strong> Lincoln frequently visited Jacksonville in the 1850s with other Springfield politicians on the 4th of July. In 1858 he came to hear his good friend and first IC graduate Richard Yates deliver an Independence Day Speech. It is fitting on this special Day of Celebration that we will mark both the end of the Jacksonville Lincoln Bicentennial and the beginning of our nation's new government which Lincoln made sure that no one ever again would forget as being forged in the words that “All men are created equal and endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights--life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” A parade. fireworks, and, perhaps, an outdoor pops symphony concert will cap the grand finale of Lincoln's 200th Anniversary Year. </p>
